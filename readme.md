# Lesson 1: Variables and Constants

-   `Variables`: There are 2 types of variables in php.

    1. General - we can change it later on if we want to.

    -   Syntax is `$variable_name = value` without number & special characters

    2. Constant - we can't change this variable value.

    -   Syntax is `$variable_name = value` without number & special characters
